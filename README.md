# Avalanche Rush

Avalanche rush is an endless runner game, where the player has to flee from an avalanche while avoiding obstacles.  It is a game similar to the Subway Surfer’s game which we have inspired from but with a multiplayer mode option. In multiplayer mode, the aim is to be the last one still in the race. Players can push each other to get the power-ups. The game ends when one of the players hits an obstacle.
